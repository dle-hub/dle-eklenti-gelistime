The main difference from the existing [xfgiven_x] and [xfnotgiven_x] tags is that you can list several fields at the same time and the filled state of all listed fields is checked simultaneously, and it is the actual filled state that is checked; for example, if a field contains “0” or the value “no”, this is also considered a filled field in the publication.

The main difference from the existing [xfgiven_x] and [xfnotgiven_x] tags is that you can list several fields at the same time and the filled state of all listed fields is checked simultaneously, and it is the actual filled state that is checked; for example, if a field contains “0” or the value “no”, this is also considered a filled field in the publication.
