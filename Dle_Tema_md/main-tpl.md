This template file is the primary file that includes all other template files from every section. It is located in main.tpl This file configures your page templates and includes the other engine components. Editing this file is not recommended without HTML knowledge, because it uses field names passed to the script through forms. In other words, you may change the text as needed, but do not change the field names, this is critically important.

#### TAG: `{headers}`

Outputs the generated meta tags for page encoding, title, keywords, and description. It also includes all required scripts. Place it in the template between the tags. This tag is required in the template.

#### TAG: `{jsfiles}`

Outputs the inclusion of all JS scripts used by DLE in the specified place in the template. With this tag, you can, for example, move all JS scripts to the very bottom of the page to speed up loading and rendering. This tag is optional, and if it is missing from the template, all scripts will be included as before via the {headers} tag. Please note that if you move script inclusion, the {AJAX} tag must also be placed below the {jsfiles} tag. You must also ensure that all third-party scripts in your template continue to work correctly if they use, for example, the jQuery library, so that they do not run before all scripts have been loaded. We strongly do not recommend that beginners use this tag; it is intended for experienced webmasters who have experience working with JS scripts.
