`[xfvalue_X format="Format"]`
Intended for outputting additional fields of the “Date and time” type where X is the name of the additional field and “Format” is the output format of the date and time set in the field. You can output this additional field in different date and time formats, not only in the default format specified in the field settings. For example, the tag [xfvalue_test format="j F Y H:i"] outputs the date and time set in the field in the j F Y H:i format.
`[ifxfset fields="X"]`
text
[/ifxfset]

Outputs the enclosed text if the field named X was set and filled for the news item. You can also list several field names separated by commas. For example, [ifxfset fields="test1,test2"]both fields named test1 and test2 are filled[/ifxfset] will output the text if both fields were filled in the news item. The main difference from the existing [xfgiven_x] and [xfnotgiven_x] tags is that you can list several fields at the same time and the filled state of all listed fields is checked simultaneously, and it is the actual field completion that is checked. For example, if a field contains “0” or the value “no”, it is still considered a filled field in the publication.
`[ifxfnotset fields="X"]`
text
[/ifxfnotset]

Outputs the enclosed text if the field named X was not set and filled for the news item. You can also list several field names separated by commas.

The main difference from the existing [xfgiven_x] and [xfnotgiven_x] tags is that you can list several fields at the same time and the filled state of all listed fields is checked simultaneously, and it is the actual field completion that is checked. For example, if a field contains “0” or the value “no”, it is still considered a filled field in the publication.
