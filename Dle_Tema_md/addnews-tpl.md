It is also possible to pass categories that should be selected by default through the browser URL. For this, the URL http://yoursite.com/index.php?do=addnews&category=X is used, where "X" is the ID of the required categories listed comma-separated. For example, at http://yoursite.com/index.php?do=addnews&category=3,4,5, categories with ID 1, 2, and 3 will be selected by default in the add news form on the website. This feature will be useful for websites that use additional publication fields assigned to different categories and want to provide users with several predefined publication submission forms for different categories.
